# tools-release

`tools-release` owns release lifecycle objects and immutable publication. It is
not an Electron builder.

The active exact flow is:

1. resolve content identities and accepted baselines;
2. prepare signed content and Shell requirements;
3. finalize release-neutral Shell distribution contributions;
4. publish immutable objects with readback verification;
5. collect target-bound acceptance credentials;
6. compare-and-swap the channel head.

`release-exact` is the only Electron release workflow in this slice, and
`betahyx` is its isolated Electron delivery channel. The explicit channel and
release version travel together through storage, acceptance, and activation.
A version such as `0.1.0-betahyx.1` repeats the channel as a defensive naming
convention; it does not replace the explicit channel field.

Publication eligibility is enforced by `tools-release`, for local and remote
execution alike. `stable` and `prerelease` require `refs/heads/release/vX.Y.Z`
matching the release base version. Custom channels must match `^[a-z]{3,10}$`
and may use any valid source branch with an exact source commit. The current
`exact-validation` rollout permits only `betahyx`; it is not a main-only or
local-only publishing path. Existing artifact trust, acceptance, and activation
gates remain in force. Fossil metadata readers retain their decoding grammar;
reading an old channel name does not authorize a new publication.

`exact-control` accepts an `exact.acceptance` request with `schemaVersion: 1`,
`policyReceipt`, `publishReceipt`, `shellType`, `target`, and `installedRoot`.
Electron also requires `runtimeLog`; hot acceptance adds `hotAcceptanceReceipt`,
`standaloneState`, and `standaloneGenerationsRoot`. Terminal uses
`runtimeProofRoot` for its install/start/status/stop receipts. The collector
selects the required target from the published topology and rejects policy
mismatches, altered installed bytes, and an incomplete latest runtime attempt.
The resulting credential is evidence binding, not a substitute for executing
the real installed lifecycle and update acceptance matrix.

Legacy channel metadata helpers remain only as file/data protocol readers and
use `resources/channel-versions.json` as the channel-owned base-version
registry. They do not build or validate Electron artifacts and cannot serve as
an acceptance path.
