# Output contract & scope

Loaded once per build, at handoff time.

## Output contract

When producing new work:

- Put design tokens in one place at the top of the stylesheet (`:root` custom properties) or in a `tokens.css` / `tokens.ts` file if the project uses one.
- Name tokens by semantic role, not value. `--color-ink`, not `--color-black`.
- If the project uses Tailwind, extend the theme; do not inline arbitrary values across components.
- If the project uses a framework, match the framework's file conventions — don't reinvent them.
- Include a short comment block at the top of the stylesheet naming the genre, the tone the user picked, the palette's anchor hue, and the structural fingerprint. This is the only comment you need.

## Scope and limits

Hallmark is a *taste* skill. It will not:

- Invent product copy. If the user hasn't given you the words, ask.
- Pick a brand identity. It will follow one you give it.
- Enforce a specific style (dark mode, glassmorphism, brutalism). It will execute whichever genre + tone the user committed to.
- Build logic — state management, data fetching, business rules. It is a visual / interaction layer only.

If a request falls outside taste — "build the auth flow", "wire up Stripe" — do the work, but apply Hallmark to the rendered surface.
