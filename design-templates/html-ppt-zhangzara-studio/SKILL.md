Subject: A photography studio's portfolio-and-rate deck — the signature work, the process, and the packages that win the brief. Audience: prospective clients. First ask only for missing essentials: audience, decision target, source-of-truth materials, deadline, and must-keep numbers. Then produce the slide plan, written slides, visual direction, speaker-ready structure, and a critic pass against this rubric: does the deck feel authored by a senior designer rather than generated."

# Studio

> Black canvas with electric-yellow type; high-voltage design studio aesthetic.

A single self-contained HTML deck — typography, palette, decorative system,
and slide vocabulary are all tuned together. Mixing layouts across templates
breaks the system; stay inside this one.

## At a glance

- **Scheme:** dark
- **Formality:** medium
- **Density:** medium
- **Slides in demo:** 12

## Best for

Anything that should feel electric and design-led: studio credentials, creative agency pitches, brand showcases, art-direction reviews, fashion / sneaker brand work. Also a striking unexpected choice for tech, research, or business decks where the speaker wants the deck to *be* a brand statement.

## Avoid for

Contexts that should feel quiet or institutional — the black-and-electric-yellow palette is the loudest in the library.

## Workflow

1. **Clone `example.html`** into the user's workspace as the working file.
2. **Replace placeholder content** with the user's real headlines, body copy,
   numbers, names, dates, and section labels. Match existing dimensions when
   swapping image placeholders.
3. **Preserve the design system.** Never substitute fonts, recolor the palette,
   restructure the layout grid, or strip decorative elements (corner brackets,
   paper grain, geometric shapes, illustrated SVGs). They are part of the
   identity.
4. **Adjust deck length by duplicating layouts.** If the user has more content
   than the demo holds, duplicate an existing slide of the most appropriate
   layout. If less, drop slides from the bottom. Update page-number labels.
5. **Designing missing layouts:** if a slide needs a layout the template
   doesn't have, design it from scratch using the same fonts, palette,
   decorative vocabulary, spacing rhythm, and component grammar — never bail
   to a different template.
6. **Keep the navigation runtime as shipped.** If the deck ships an
   `assets/deck-stage.js` or inline keyboard handler, leave it intact.
